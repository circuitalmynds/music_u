#7 Australia. This is the original 1980 Casablanca/PolyGram Australia music video for The Skatt Brothers Life At The Outpost. This official video was done by the Australian record company, without the actual Skatt Brothers, when repeated requests to the bands management company to produce a video for Life At The Outpost went unanswered.
